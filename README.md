This is a [MongoDB Charts](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/charts/) project bootstrapped with [`Next.JS`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can use this code to walk through and see how to embed charts (unauthenticated access) via:
1. iframe
2. charts SDK
3. filtering for specific countries
4. dark / light mode

**To walk through the code:**
__1. Navigate to /pages/index.js to view the code on how to use the iFrame embedding of charts and apply filtering on the iFrames__
__2. Navigate to /pages/charts.js to view the code on how to use the Charts SDK to embed charts and apply filtering on the embedded charts__
